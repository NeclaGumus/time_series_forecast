Project Introduction: Forecasting Store Sales

In this project, I explored historical sales data from a retail store with the aim of understanding sales patterns and making future predictions.

The dataset includes daily sales numbers along with store and promotional information.

My main goal was to practice working with time series data and build a basic forecasting model using Python.

I focused on:

cleaning and preparing the data,

exploring trends and seasonality,

and creating forecasts with SARIMA models.

Towards the end, I also experimented with Prophet to see how it handles real-world seasonality and trends.

The ability to forecast sales is important for businesses to plan inventory, staffing, and marketing activities better.

Through this project, I tried to simulate a real business scenario and apply forecasting techniques in a practical way.
